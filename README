* Companion iPhone Core Data project from blog post *

My project is moving along, I hope to hit some milestones in the next few days! For now, I wanted to talk about how I'm using Core Data, and build a simple RSS feed reader to demonstrate it's use...

What I'm going over:

   1. Create a project with Core Data
   2. Create the Database
   3. Fetch and Parse RSS feed
   4. Dump to Database
   5. Display to tableView
